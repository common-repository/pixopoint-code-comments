== Description ==

Sorry, but this plugin is very old and no longer maintained. I do not recommend using it.

The <a href="https://geek.hellyer.kiwi/products/code-comments/">PixoPoint Code Comments plugin</a> allows your site visitors to post fragments of code in their comments (wrapped in <code>...</code>) which are automatically encoded instead of them having to convert them to HTML entities such as &gt; and &lt;.

This plugin is based on code posted by Kaspars Dambis on his blog
